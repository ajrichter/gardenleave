XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP, a free and easy-to-use web server package that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. Place your index.php file in the htdocs folder (usually located at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or ~/xampp/htdocs on Mac/Linux). Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/index.php.
MAMP: If you're on a Mac, you can use MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP) instead. Install MAMP, place your index.php file in the htdocs folder (usually located at ~/MAMP/htdocs), and access it at http://localhost:8888/index.php (or the port number you specified during installation).
Online PHP Sandbox: If you don't want to set up a local web server, you can use an online PHP sandbox like Repl.it, CodeSandbox, or PHPFiddle. Upload your index.php file to one of these platforms, and they'll provide a URL where you can access your script.

PHP Built-in Server: If you have PHP installed on your system, you can use the built-in server. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your index.php file is located, and run the command php -S localhost:8000. Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/index.php.
